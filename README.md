### Description

This project is intended to mimic the freelance process of designing and developing a website for a client. In this case, the client is a newly constructed co-working space who have a clear vision for their space and website. Given the following conversation snippets, this project is an attempt to meet the clients' needs.

* "We just finished remodeling our space. We're really proud of it. We want our online presence to mirror our in-person presence, to attract people that would really enjoy working in our environment." (They later email you the following photos detailing their space's aesthetic: coffee counter area, communal workspace, one of our meeting areas, front entrance, front entrance looking out).

* "We want our space--no, our whole company--to feel a little luxurious, cool, and high-end; yet still 100% welcoming and inclusive to everyone. A safe, comfortable, and productive work environment, you know?"

* "I also think it's really important convey our unique personality. It's what sets us apart from the 'big guys' in the field. You know, places like WeWork and TechSpace. We think we're more funky, more local, less corporate, and a little more fun."

* "We want to avoid catering solely to tech. You walk into some of these other coworking spaces, and you only ever see people working on code. That's great, but we'd also love to see artists, daytraders, craftspeople, writers, counselors, more traditional business people--you know, anyone and everyone--in our space."

* "Our site should also show what amenities we have. We have an on-site coffee counter, both communal working areas and private offices, high-speed internet, printing and faxing services, and we usually have a fun, optional activity on Thursday afternoons. Like yoga, maybe a fun complementary food, or like...I don't know, maybe even crafts sometimes (come make your own mini desktop terrarium)?"
